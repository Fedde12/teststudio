# Your First Project #

Once you have successfully installed and activated Test Studio, you are ready to create your first automation test. The process is devided in several steps:

- [Create new project](#create-new-project)
- [Calibrate your browser](#calibrate-your-browser)

## Create New Project ##

When you launch Test Studio, you will see the Welcome Screen. It lets you open or create projects, see notifications about software updates and news related to the product.

In the Create project section you could choose among different type projects - **Web & Desktop**, **Mobile** or **API**. Lets select a **Web & Desktop** project and specify its name and location. Click on the 'Create' button.

*Open Projects* tab allows you to open an existing local project. 

You can explore a sample **Web & Desktop** or **API** project, from the *Get Started* section. And you can learn more about the **Mobile** project.

## Calibrate Your Browser ##

Once the test project is created you need to calibrate the browser, in this case we will be using Internet Explorer. This is done to ensure flawless and consistent automation process. There are some settings to apply to the browser and we have implemented a feature to [automatically calibrate the browser](/features/project-settings/browsers) out of the box and no manual interaction is required.

>**Note:** Other supported browsers like [Chrome](/getting-started/configure-your-browser/chrome) and [Firefox](/getting-started/configure-your-browser/firefox) require the Progress Test Studio extension, where [Microsoft Edge](/getting-started/configure-your-browser/edge) uses the WebDriver.
