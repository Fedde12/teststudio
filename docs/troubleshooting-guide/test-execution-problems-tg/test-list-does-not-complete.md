# Test List Does Not Complete

## PROBLEM

When executing a test list, the test list execution does not complete and the execution browser does not close. 

## SOLUTION

This behavior may be caused by a test with the **RecycleBrowser** <a href="/getting-started/test-execution/test-list-settings" target="_blank">test list setting</a> enabled. Try disabling this setting.
