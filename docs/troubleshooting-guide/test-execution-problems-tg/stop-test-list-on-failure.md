# Stop Test List On Failure

## PROBLEM

You would like to stop execution on a test list if one of its tests encounters an error. Currently, when an error occurs, it marks that test as failed but continues to run the remaining tests in the list.

## SOLUTION

Enable the **StopTestListOnFailure** <a href="/features/test-maintenance/test-properties-standalone" target="_blank">Test Property</a> for the applicable test(s).


1.&nbsp; Go to the **Project** tab. 

2.&nbsp; **Highlight** the test.

3.&nbsp; Right click the test and select **Properties**.

4.&nbsp; Check the **StopTestListOnFailure** box.
