#Step Builder

The Step Builder is a feature that allows you to add steps to your test manually. In order to access it click the **Step Builder** tab in the lower right corner. The Step Builder appears. 

> You should select an element from the [DOM Explorer]({% slug ms-dom-explorer%}) in order to add a step for that element.

> Some of the Step Builder steps are available only when a test is in record mode.

If no element is selected from the DOM only the common step suggestions appear.

The Step Builder is a context aware feature and the steps that are only related to the selected element appear. The main categories are Actions, Verifications and Wait.

<table id="no-table">
	<tr>
		<td>![Actions](/img/test-studio-mobile/test-recording/step-builder/fig2.png) <br><br>**Actions**</td>
		<td>![Verifications](/img/test-studio-mobile/test-recording/step-builder/fig3.png) <br><br>**Verifications**</td>
		<td>![Wait](/img/test-studio-mobile/test-recording/step-builder/fig4.png) <br><br> **Wait**</td>
	</tr>
<table>

You can add a step by double clicking on the step or by clicking the **Add Step** button.
