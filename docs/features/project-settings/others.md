## Highlighting

The "Automation Overlay Surface" defines the highlight border color, border width and the amount of time before the Elements Menu displays.<br>

Click the **Border button** to display a color selector and use the sliders to adjust **Highlight Border Width** and **Menu Hold Time**. Delaying the Elements Menu display can be helpful if you're trying to hover the mouse and the Elements Menu is popping up too quickly.
