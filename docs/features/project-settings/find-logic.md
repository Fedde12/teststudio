# Find Logic (Html)

As elements are added to the **Elements Explorer**, Test Studio uses an intelligent element identification scheme to auto-generate find expressions. When an element is ready to be added to the Elements Explorer, Test Studio tries to use the first item in the list (usually "**id**"). Using this criteria, if the item is unique for the entire page, the element is added, a find expression is created, and Test Studio stops evaluating.<br> 

You can **add** new tags to the list, **reorder** them, or **delete** them (except for TextContent and TagIndex which are locked from deletion).
