# TeamPulse Integration

Test Studio comes with support for Telerik's agile project management solution – <a href="http://www.telerik.com/agile-project-management-tools/" target="_blank">TeamPulse</a>. The integration with the agile tool enables linking between user stories and acceptance criteria from TeamPulse to tests within Test Studio. Thus users can further facilitate business owners – testers' communication by bringing transparency to converting requirements into tests.
