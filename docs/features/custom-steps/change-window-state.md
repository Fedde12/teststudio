# Change Window State

This feature is WPF-specific and is only available in a WPF Test. **Capture Window** is also available - it is used just like <a href="/features/custom-steps/capture" target="_blank">Capture Browser</a>.

As of version 2015 R1 you can find the custom steps in the <a href="/getting-started/test-recording/step-suggestions" target="_blank">Step Builder</a> under General section.

Be sure to enter the applicable WindowCaption so Test Studio acts on the correct window. The WindowState options are:

-  Normal
-  Minimized
-  Maximized
-  Closed
