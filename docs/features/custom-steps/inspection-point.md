# Inspection Point

This step will pause the test and display the DOM Explorer. This is useful for viewing and inspecting the DOM at a specific point in the test. You can check that a specific element remains as you originally recorded it or if you need to change its <a href="/features/elements-explorer/find-element" target="_blank">Find Expression</a>.
