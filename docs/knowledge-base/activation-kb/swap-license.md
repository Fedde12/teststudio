# Swap a Test Studio License between machines #

*You have a single Test Studio license which you would like to swap between different machines. For instance: you would like to use Test Studio at your workplace and then use it on your home PC without having to purchase an additional license.*

## Solution ##

Test Studio utilizes a per-machine licensing model. This means your license can be activated multiple times on different machines, but not simultaneously.

To **swap** a license between multiple machines:

1. Install Test Studio on each machine.

2. Activate one of those instances with your license and use it.

3. When you want to migrate the license to a different machine, deactivate the current instance.

4. Then activate Test Studio on the other machine.

### Standalone versoin ###

In Test Studio Standalone version you can deactivate/activate your license from the **Manage License** sub-menu. You can access this menu from the **Help** drop down in the upper right corner:

![Manage license][1]

After you click the Manage License button the following window appear. Click on **Change License** button.

After this you get the option to **Deactivate**.
